# TIY-2-3-T-Shirt-Cost

The Iron Yard Cincinnati week 2, day 3 assignment.  This was updated with the week 2, day 4 assignment as well.  This assignment added to the previous one by adding the time the item was added to the cart with moment js.  I also added some animation when the cart opens as well as using obejcts and arrays to store the product info on the page. 

First Javascript assignment involving creating a shopping cart and modifying UI elements.
